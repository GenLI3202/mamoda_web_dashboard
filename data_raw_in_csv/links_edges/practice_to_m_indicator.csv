p_econ_impact,m0,4.5,"Practice focuses on creating jobs, a key component of the Operational Footprint indicator."
p_econ_impact,m2,4.0,"Actions like local procurement and benefit-sharing are designed to increase the mining value added to local GDP."
p_econ_impact,m15,5.0,"The practice's focus on workforce training and capacity building directly improves the ratio of skilled local employment."
p_econ_impact,m17,-2.0,"If not managed well, focusing only on 'local' can sometimes create tensions or perceived inequities with non-local domestic workers."
p_ghg_management,m25,4.0,"This practice, by definition, improves resource efficiency, especially EnergyConsumption/Production and CO2/Production."
p_ghg_management,m27,-1.0,"Some renewable technologies or CCS infrastructure could have minor, localized air quality impacts during construction."
p_air_quality,m27,5.0,"The entire practice is designed to directly measure and improve air quality dynamics."
p_air_quality,m22,-2.0,"Poor air quality is a known contributor to occupational health issues and can increase injury risk."
p_air_quality,m9,3.0,"Improving air quality is a major factor in improving community satisfaction and reducing complaints."
p_air_quality,m30,2.0,"Airborne pollutants often settle, contributing to soil contamination. Controlling air emissions helps reduce this."

p_bio_mgmt,m28,4.0,"Biodiversity management is intrinsically linked to planning and funding for land restoration and reclamation."
p_bio_mgmt,m1,4.0,"Applying the mitigation hierarchy helps avoid or minimize the disruption of agricultural activity."
p_bio_mgmt,m24,-1.0,"Land use changes and deforestation can alter water runoff patterns, potentially impacting water quality dynamics."
p_water_mgmt,m24,5.0,"The practice is explicitly designed to manage discharge and prevent contamination, directly improving this water quality indicator."
p_water_mgmt,m25,4.0,"Improving water use efficiency is a core action of this practice, leading to better resource consumption ratios (NetWater/Production)."
p_water_mgmt,m30,4.0,"Effective effluent management and Acid Mine Drainage prevention directly reduce the toxic releases measured by this indicator."
p_water_mgmt,m29,3.0,"By managing water quality, the practice reduces the pollution-related impact on local ecosystems."
p_water_mgmt,m9,3.0,"Engaging with water users and mitigating impacts helps improve community relations and satisfaction."
