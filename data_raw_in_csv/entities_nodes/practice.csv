p_ghg_mitigation,"Climate Change Mitigation","Env","Aims to reduce direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2 & 3) greenhouse gas emissions in line with climate science, contributing to the global transition to a low-carbon economy.","GRI 14.1; GRI 14.2; SDSN Indicator Report","Requires substantial upfront capital for renewable energy projects and fleet electrification. Integrating new technologies can be operationally complex and dependent on local grid stability. Scope 3 data collection remains a challenge.","","","",""
p_air_quality,"Air Quality Management","Env,Soc","Aims to prevent and mitigate air pollution (e.g., SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter, heavy metals) from all mining activities to protect the health of workers and local communities, and to minimize impacts on ecosystems.","GRI 14.3; SDSN Indicator Report","Presents significant operational challenges, especially managing dust from large-scale open-pit mines. Controlling toxic emissions (e.g., mercury from smelting) can require specialized and costly technology.","","","",""
p_bio_mgmt,"Biodiversity Management","Env","Aims to manage and mitigate the direct and indirect impacts of mining on all levels of biodiversity (ecosystems, species, genetics) by applying the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, restore, offset).","GRI 14.4","Impacts can be severe and extend beyond the mine site, including deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and pollution. The increasing demand for minerals drives activities into more ecologically sensitive areas, heightening risks.","","","",""
p_water_mgmt,"Water and Effluents Management","Env","Aims to manage water as a shared resource by ensuring the efficiency of its operational use and mitigating the impacts of its discharge to protect human health, ecosystems, and the long-term viability of local water sources.","GRI 14.7; GRI 14.2","Impacts on water availability and quality are significant and can persist beyond mine closure. Operations in water-stressed regions intensify competition for resources and can exacerbate tensions with local communities.","","","",""
